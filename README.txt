fibserviceTest.py
	This file contains the tests to test the functionality of all the global functions in 
	fibservice.py

	To run the tests, type the following at the command:
		python fibserviceTest.py
	
	3 tests will be run and the following output generated if all the tests pass.

		testfibonacci (__main__.TestGlobalFunctions) ... ok
		testget_fibonacci (__main__.TestGlobalFunctions) ... ok
		testget_negative_error (__main__.TestGlobalFunctions) ... ok
